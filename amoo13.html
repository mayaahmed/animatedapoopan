<h3> Chapter 13  </h3>
<h2>May their souls rest in peace</h2>

<p> Amooma's mother died. But before she died she had an urge to eat mangoes.
When Amooma told this to the village priest, he said </p>

<p> "Now your mother's soul will find no peace. If you want her soul to
find peace, you must make a golden mango and give it to a holy man like
me." </p>

<p> "I am a poor woman. I cannot afford to give golden mangoes to holy
men" said Amooma. </p>

<p> "Either that or your mother's soul will be tormented" said the
priest. </p>

<p> Apoopan was standing nearby and listening to the conversation quietly. </p>

<p> "I will see what I can do" said Amooma pensively.  </p>

<p>"Do whatever you can. It is the matter of making a mother's soul
happy" said the priest before leaving.  </p>

<p> The priest was almost out of the gate with a big grin on his face, when
he felt a spank right on his butt. He turned in surprise to see Apoopan with
a big laddle ready to give him another big spank. </p>

<p> "What are you doing?" asked the priest in surprise. </p>

<p> "My father's dying wish was to be spanked. I had no heart to spank
him. So now I am fulfilling his heart's desire" said Apoopan. </p>

<p> "That is impossible. I do not believe that your father wanted to be
spanked" said the priest angrily. </p>

<p> "Anything is possible in Apoopan's  family" said Amooma who
was also taken by surprise like the priest. </p>

<p> Apoopan went chasing the  priest with a laddle for some time. </p>

<p> "Enough, enough! I will say this mantra and your father will find
peace" said the priest finally.  </p>

<p> "What about Amooma's mother?" asked Apoopan. </p>

<p> "She will also find peace. I had forgotten all about this mantra" 
said the priest.  </p>

<p> The priest then quickly recited a mantra and went his way. </p>
