<h3> Chapter 17  </h3>
<h2>We could do with magic</h2>

<p> One day Apoopan decided to go to the city to find work. </p> 

<p> "The rains were not good this year" said Apoopan. "Our farms did not
do well. So I will go to the city, find work, and bring back some
money." </p> 

<p> "I will make you some appams for the journey" said Amooma. </p> 

<p> Amooma packed some appams and gave Apoopan. It was a long way to the
city. Apoopan was hungry. But if he ate soon he would get hungry again. </p> 

<p> "Should I eat the appams now?" he wondered.  </p> 

<p> He decided against it and walked a little longer. This continued for
some time. Finally, Apoopan got very hungry. He sat under a tree and 
shouted </p> 

<p> "I will eat it now." </p> 
 
<p> It so happened that an imp lived on that tree. The imp got frightened when 
he heard Apoopan shout. The imp thought Apoopan wanted to eat him. </p> 

<p> "Please do not eat me sir" pleaded the imp. </p> 

<p> Apoopan was too surprised to respond. So the imp pleaded again. </p> 

<p> "I will give you this magic pot if you do not eat me." </p> 

<p> "What can this pot do?" asked Apoopan. </p> 

<p> "I will show you" said the imp. "What do you feel like eating now?" </p> 

<p> "I would love some ice cream" said Apoopan. </p> 

<p> The imp then kept the pot on the floor and said </p> 

<p> "Magic pot, magic pot. Give Apoopan some ice cream." </p> 

<p> The magic pot got filled with ice cream. Apoopan was very happy. </p> 

<p> "With this pot we will never go hungry" said Apoopan. "I do not have
to go to the city to work. I will go back home." </p> 

<p> Apoopan headed back home. But it became dark and Apoopan did not want
to cross the forest in the dark. So he stopped at a friend's house for
the night. </p> 

<p> "Apoopan, you are headed back from the city so soon. What happened?"
asked Apoopan's friend. </p> 

<p> "I do not have to work any more" said Apoopan. "I have this magic
pot. We will never go hungry again." </p> 

<p> "How is that possible?" asked Apoopan's friend.  </p> 

<p> "Tell me what you feel like eating now?" asked Apoopan. </p> 

<p> "Jilebis" said Apoopan's friend. </p> 

<p> Apoopan kept the pot on the floor and said  </p> 

<p> "Magic pot, magic pot. Give my friend some jilebis." </p> 

<p> The magic pot soon got filled with jilebis to the wonder of Apoopan's
friend. The two friends ate jilebis and then went to sleep.
The next day Apoopan reached home. </p> 

<p> "You are back so soon!" exclaimed Amooma.  </p> 

<p> "I have found a magic pot" said Apoopan. "I do not have to go to the
city to find work. We are rich."   </p> 

<p> "Really!" said Amooma.  </p> 

<p> "I will show you some magic" said Apoopan. "I will also show our
neighbors what this magic pot can do."  </p> 

<p> Apoopan then called all the villagers to his house and asked every one 
what they liked to eat.  </p> 

<p> "Vadas" said a little boy.  </p> 

<p> "Idlis" said an old man.  </p> 

<p> "Ice cream" said a little girl.  </p> 

<p> "I will get it for you" said Apoopan with a grin. He then placed the 
pot on the floor and said  </p> 

<p> "Magic pot, magic pot. Give this little girl some ice cream."  </p> 

<p> No ice cream filled the pot.  </p> 

<p> "Magic pot, magic pot. Give this little boy some vadas."  </p> 

<p> Again nothing happened.  This went on for some time. All the people
gathered slowly left and some were openly laughing. Some people thought
Apoopan had gone mad. Apoopan stood alone sad and confused.  </p> 

<p> "I will have to go back to the city to find work" he said slowly.  </p> 

<p> On his way to the city again Apoopan saw the tree in which the imp
lived. He suddenly felt quite angry about being cheated. He went and
stood under the tree and shouted  </p> 

<p> "I will eat the imp. I surely will."  </p> 

<p> The imp heard this and came down frightened.  </p> 

<p> "Please do not eat me sir" said the imp. "Did you not like the magic
pot I gave you?" </p>

<p>"Not at all. I am really angry" said Apoopan. </p>

<p> "I will give you another magic pot" said the imp. "You will surely
like this one." </p>

<p> The imp gave him another pot which would fill up with gold coins when
commanded. Apoopan headed back to the village happily with the magic
pot in hand. He stopped at his friend's house for the night again.  </p>

<p> "You are back again!  Did you find another magic pot?" asked
Apoopan's friend. </p>

<p> "Yes, I did" said Apoopan and showed him his magic pot. </p>

<p> The next day Apoopan reached home. He gathered the people of his
village and said proudly </p>

<p> "This time I have a magic pot that gets filled with gold coins on
command." </p>

<p> Apoopan then placed the pot on the floor and said </p>

<p> "Magic pot, magic pot. Give me some gold coins." </p>

<p> Nothing happened. The villagers left laughing aloud this time.
They were convinced Apoopan had gone mad. Apoopan got very angry.
He rushed to the tree where the imp lived and shouted </p>

<p>"I will eat you now, imp. Nothing can save you." </p>
 
<p> The imp came down and asked </p>

<p> "Why are you angry, sir?" </p>

<p> "Both the pots you gave me were no magic pots" said Apoopan. "I
became a fool twice in front of the whole village  because of
you. I hate you. I am going to eat you." </p>

<p> "The pots were surely magic" said the imp. "Did you stop somewhere
before you reached home?"  </p>

<p>"I stopped at a friends house" said Apoopan. </p>

<p> "Did you tell him about your magic pots?" asked the imp. </p>

<p> "Yes, I told him about the magic pots" said Apoopan. </p>

<p> "Your friend replaced your pots. I will now give you a stick that
will beat a person until you ask it to stop. It will help you make your
friend confess to his thefts." </p>

<p> Apoopan took the stick from the imp and went to his friend's house. </p>

<p> "Did you bring more magical pots from the city?" asked Apoopan's friend. </p>

<p> "I brought a magical stick this time" said Apoopan. </p>

<p> "What can it do?" asked Apoopan's friend. </p>

<p>"I will show you" said Apoopan. "Magic stick, start your work on my friend."  </p>

<p> The stick started beating Apoopan's friend. Apoopan's friend soon started
screaming in pain and said   </p>

<p> "Please stop, I will return your magic pots."  </p>

<p>  Apoopan commanded the stick to stop and his friend returned Apoopan's
magic pots.  Thus Apoopan returned to the village once again without
going to the city.  Apoopan called upon the villagers again to visit
his house to witness magic. The villagers were skeptical but decided
to go for laughs.  </p>

<p> Apoopan summoned the first magic pot to feed the villagers all kind of
treats.  Then he filled the second magic pot with gold coins and
distributed it to all the villagers. As the villagers were leaving
Apoopan asked the stick to whack every guest once.  </p>

<p> "Ouch! What was that for?" asked a guest.  </p>

<p> "That is for laughing at a distressed old man the last two times"
said Apoopan laughing.  </p>
