<h3> Chapter 3  </h3>
<h2>Sleeping sentinels</h2>

<p> A monkey ate mangoes from Apoopan's yard every night.  Therefore
Apoopan and Amooma decided to catch the monkey and punish him. They
made a plan. Apoopan brought two big sticks and gave one to Amooma and said </p>

<p> "I will sit on top of the tree with this stick. You hold this
stick. When the monkey turns up I will hit him with my stick. If the
monkey falls on the ground you hit him with your stick."  </p>

<p> "That is a good plan" said Amooma.  </p>

<p> That night, Apoopan went and sat on the tree and Amooma kept watch on
the ground. After sometime Apoopan dozed off. Amooma did the
same. Like every night the monkey came to eat mangoes. When he saw
Amooma and Apoopan, the monkey left quietly.  </p>

<p> After some time Apoopan fell from the top of the tree with a thud.
Amooma thought it was the monkey and woke up with a start. Since it
was very dark, Amooma could not see Apoopan. Thus Apoopan received
a couple of  blows before Amooma realized her folly.   </p>

<p> "Sleeping while keeping watch serves no purpose" said Amooma.  </p>
