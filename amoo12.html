<h3> Chapter 12  </h3>
<h2> Yes Boss!  </h2>

<p> Once Apoopan was invited to a rich Zamindar's feast. The Zamindar was
a egomaniac and he liked people to treat him like a king. Most people
did just that, for as long he was pleased, they got to eat, drink, and
party for free. </p>

<p> Apoopan had a good time at the feast. Soon it was dessert time and
delicious payasam (rice pudding) was served. Everyone was eating
payasam with great joy when suddenly the Zamindar exclaimed </p>

<p> "Yuck! This Payasam is no good. It is bitter. I cannot eat a drop of
it." </p>

<p> Everyone else in the room agreed and they said </p>

<p> "Yes, yes. It is bitter. It is no good."  </p>

<p> They stopped eating the payasam with heavy hearts. However, Apoopan
continued eating the payasam with great pleasure. </p>

<p> "Don't you find the payasam bitter? How come you are still eating it?"
asked the Zamindar.  </p>

<p> Apoopan did not want to contradict the Zamindar but he also did
not want to miss out on the payasam. So he said with a grin </p>

<p> "I like the bitterness of payasam, Sir." </p>


<p> The Zamindar and his guests laughed a lot at Apoopan's answer. But only
Apoopan got to eat payasam that day. </p>
