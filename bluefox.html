<h3> Chapter 15  </h3>
<h2> The Blue Fox.</h2>
        

<p> One day a hungry fox came to Apoopan's village to steal some
chickens. But the dogs saw the fox and gave it a chase. The fox
entered Apoopan's house to hide.  Amooma had added some blue powder to
a bucket of water to dip her white laundry. The fox fell in to this
bucket of blue water. When the fox came out of the bucket, he had
turned a bright blue color. </p>

<p> When the blue fox emerged from Apoopan's house, the dogs got  scared
and ran away. This gave the fox quite a thrill. He went to the forest
and scared all the animals. The blue fox was a mysterious creature no
one had seen  in the forest before. He boasted of the power to turn
animals to dust.  He pushed everyone around.  Even lions and tigers
were scared of the blue fox. </p>

<p> Soon it was a full moon night. All the foxes in the forest began
to howl at the moon. The blue fox forgot himself and joined in the
howling.  This revealed his identity as a fox to the animals of the
forest. All the animals gathered around the fox and gave him a good
thrashing. </p>

<p> "He could change his appearance but not his nature" said a wise
elephant. </p>
