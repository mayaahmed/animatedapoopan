<h3> Chapter 14  </h3>
<h2>Think of me more</h2>

<p> One day Apoopan met an old friend after a long time.  The two of them
went to a tea shop and were talking about this and that when Apoopan's
friend got a hiccup.</p>

<p> "My wife must be thinking of me. You get hiccups only when someone
is thinking of you" said Apoopan's friend. </p>

<p> A couple of minutes later the friend got another hiccup and he said
"My wife must be missing me too much." </p>

<p> Later, when Apoopan reached home, Apoopan complained to Amooma </p>


<p> "You never think of me. I never got a single hiccup. My friend got
two hiccups when he was with me for a short time. His wife is a more
caring wife than you." </p>


<p> And Apoopan went sulking around the house all day saying </p>


<p> "You do not think of me enough, you do not think of me enough." </p>


<p> Finally, Amooma got angry and decided to teach Apoopan a lesson.  The
next day as Apoopan was going to the farm, Amooma gave him a lunch box
as usual but she added a lot of chili powder to the curry. After
lunch, Apoopan went and sat under a tree to rest. And soon enough
Apoopan got a hiccup. He was very happy and said to himself </p>


<p> "Ha! Amooma must be thinking of me." </p>


<p> But then there was another hiccup, and then another, and then another,
till Apoopan was tired of hiccups. </p>


<p> When Apoopan reached home that day he asked Amooma angrily </p>


<p> "Why couldn't you think of me a little less? Why did you have to go
off limits about thinking of me?" </p>


"Sorry. I am just a silly old woman" said Amooma hiding a smile. </p>
