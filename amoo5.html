<h3> Chapter 5  </h3>
<h2>Unpaid service </h2>
        
<p> "Amooma, make me some payasam (rice pudding)" said Apoopan. "I feel
like eating payasam." </p>

<p> "You will have to go to the forest and collect some firewood" said
Amooma.  "Only then can I cook any payasam."  </p>

<p> Apoopan went to collect firewood in the forest. Suddenly he saw
an elephant in front of him and he was very angry. </p>

<p> "How dare you come and disturb my forest?" the elephant roared. </p>

<p> "I just wanted to collect some firewood. Amooma will make some
payasam for me if I do" said Apoopan. </p>

<p> "Does she make good payasam?" asked the elephant. </p>

<p> "Yes" said Apoopan. He went on to elaborate fondly how good the
Payasam tasted. </p>

<p> "Your description of the payasam makes my mouth water" said the
elephant. "Give me some of it and I will help you collect firewood." </p>

<p> "Sure" said Apoopan. </p>

<p> The elephant gathered firewood and carried it for Apoopan
all the way out of the forest. </p>

<p> "When can I come for the payasam?" asked the elephant. </p>

<p> "As soon as you see a smoke emitting from the chimney in my house" said
Apoopan. </p>

<p> Amooma made the payasam and the couple sat down to eat. </p>

<p> "We must save some payasam for the elephant" said Apoopan. </p>

<p> "We must certainly do that" said Amooma. </p>

<p> Amooma and Apoopan ate and ate and finally there was no more payasam
left. </p>

<p> "Oh my goodness! We finished the payasam. Now what shall we do?" asked
Amooma. </p>

<p> The elephant had seen the smoke.  Apoopan could hear the elephant
approaching the house. </p>

<p> "We must hide quickly" said Apoopan. The couple went and hid in the
attic. </p>

<p> The elephant came and saw that Apoopan was missing and the payasam pot
was empty. The elephant roared in anger and shook the house
violently. But Amooma and Apoopan did not make a sound. After all the
futile display of anger the elephant decided to lick the remains of
the payasam from the pot. The elephant carried the payasam pot away. </p>

<p> "The elephant is taking my pot away" said Amooma. </p>

<p> "Keep quiet" whispered Apoopan. "Your life is more important than a
pot. Do not make a sound. All this dust in the attic is making me want
to sneeze really bad. I hope this elephant goes away soon." </p>

<p> The elephant on the way out saw the mango tree full of ripe mangoes in
Apoopan's yard.  The elephant plucked the mangoes and collected it
in the pot. </p>

<p> "He will finish all the mangoes" whispered Apoopan in dismay. </p>

<p> The pot slowly filled with the best mangoes from the tree. As the
elephant began to leave with the pot full of mangoes, Apoopan could
withhold his sneeze no longer. He sneezed  loudly. </p>

<p> The poor elephant thought that someone fired a gun. He left the
pot and ran away with all his might. </p>

<p> "The elephant helped us make payasam and he also plucked all these
mangoes for us" said Apoopan. "The elephant got nothing in return." </p>

<p>  "I also did not lose my pot" said Amooma happily. "This surely was
not the elephant's day." </p>
