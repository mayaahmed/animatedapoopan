<h3> Chapter 2 </h3>
<h2> Greed for Appams </h2>

<P> One day Amooma made appams (rice cakes). She made five of them. After
eating two each both Amooma and Apoopan wanted the fifth appam for
themselves. </p>

<P> "Let us make a deal. We will both lie down and keep quiet with our
eyes shut. The first one to utter a sound or make any kind of movement
will not get the appam" said Apoopan. </p>

<P> "Agreed" said Amooma. </p>

<P> So the two of them laid down making no sound, with their eyes shut,
and hardly breathing. A neighbor who wanted to borrow some match
sticks came and found them thus. All her attempts to get some response
from them failed. She panicked and made a big ruckus. The villagers
gathered around thinking that Amooma and Apoopan were dead. </p>

<P> "Let us bury them" said the priest. </p>

<P> The villagers got a pair of coffins in a hurry. They put Amooma and
Apoopan in the coffins and took them to the burial ground. But when it
was time to shut the coffin Apoopan's coffin turned out to be a little
small. </p>

<P> "Let us just break his leg" said one man. "After all he is dead."  </p>

<P> "Let us do that" said another. </p>

<P> All the villagers agreed to break Apoopan's leg to make him fit in the
coffin. Hearing this Apoopan jumped up with a start and said </p>

<P> "No, no, no! Please spare my legs." </p>
 
<P> "I win the appam" shouted Amooma and ran towards the house. </p>

<P> But when Amooma reached home to eat her appam there was no appam left.</p>

<P> "I thought since you were dead, I would rather eat the appam" 
said the neighbor's kid. "I must admit it was quite good." </p>

<P> "Greed gets you nothing except trouble" said Amooma. </p>
