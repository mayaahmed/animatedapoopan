<h3> Chapter 16  </h3>
<h2>Forcing fortune to smile</h2>
        

<p> Two crows called Ram-crow and Shyam-crow lived on a tree near
Apoopan's house. Ram-crow was honest but very poor. Shyam-crow was
rich, arrogant, and greedy. </p>

<p> One evening Ram-crow went to Shyam-crow's nest to watch
television. Shyam-crow made a false story that his television was not
working and did not invite Ram-crow in to his nest. As soon as
Ram-crow left the door, Shyam-crow switched on the television. </p>


<p> Ram-crow could hear the television from outside. He felt hurt. He went
and sat on a branch and started swinging on it. Swings are fun and
Ram-crow got carried away and rocked the branch too hard. The branch
broke, and Ram-crow landed on the ground. A thorn pricked his feet.
Ram-crow went over to Apoopan's house and Apoopan gave him an
antibiotic pill. </p>

<p> "Eat half a pill now and the other half after a meal" said Apoopan. </p>

<p> Ram-crow went over to the well to get water to drink with his pill. He
sat on the boundary of the well and broke his pill in to half. In the
process he dropped one half of the pill in to the well. Ram-crow dived
in to the well to retrieve it but he came back with a huge chunk of gold. </p>

<p> Soon Ram-crow owned a big screen television and his nest looked
prosperous.  Shyam-crow became curious about how Ram-crow gained his
wealth. So one day Shyam-crow asked Ram-crow about it. Ram-crow told
him the whole story.  </p>

<p> Shyam-crow then tried to get rich like Ram-crow. He sat on a branch
and he started swinging on it hard. The branch would not break. He
pecked at it till it broke. He fell on the ground alright but no thorn
pricked his feet. He did have a few broken feathers though. He pricked
his foot with a thorn himself and then went to Apoopan. Apoopan gave
him an antibiotic pill and told him to take half of it right away and
half of it after a meal. </p>

<p>  Shyam-crow then went and sat on the boundary of the well and broke the
pill in to halves. But no half of the pill fell in to the
well. So Shyam-crow dropped one half of the pill in the well. He then
dived in to the well to retrieve it  only to come back with a huge
lump of clay in his beak. </p>
