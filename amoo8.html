<h3> Chapter 8  </h3>
<h2>Shrinking beans </h2>
      
<p>  Apoopan planted a bean plant for the first time. It grew plenty of
beans. One day Amooma said "Give me some beans to cook." </p>

<p> "Okay" said Apoopan. "But you should not waste a single bean." </p>

<p> "Yes" said Amooma. </p>

<p> Apoopan measured up beans in a glass and gave it to Amooma. When
Amooma cooked it, the quantity of beans reduced and became half a
glass. When Apoopan saw this, he became angry and  kicked up a
fuss. </p>

<p> "I will show you how to cook beans without wasting any" said
Apoopan. "You women do not know how to cook." </p>

<p> The next day Apoopan cooked a glass of beans and it turned in to half
a glass too. </p>

<p> "Beans do shrink in quantity when cooked!" exclaimed Apoopan. </p>

<p> "This teaches you to not jump to conclusions without understanding
the full picture" said Amooma. </p>
