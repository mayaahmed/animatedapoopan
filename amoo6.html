<h3> Chapter 6  </h3>
<h2> Amooma's poultry farm </h2>
      

<p>  Amooma had a thriving chicken farm but she never cooked any chicken
for Apoopan. She kept saying "Let the number grow and then we will
eat some." </p>

<p>  Apoopan had a burning desire to eat chicken. One day he said "There
is a goddess living in the Pipal tree. If you cook chicken and offer
it to the goddess, your chicken farm will grow by leaps and bounds.
You must cook it with great care." </p>

<p>  Consequently, Amooma made fried chicken, often, and placed it under
the Pipal tree to please the goddess.  Apoopan would go and eat it
secretly after she left. Amooma's poultry farm shrank rapidly. </p>

<p>  "May be the goddess is not pleased with your chicken fry" said
Apoopan. "You should try harder and cook  better."  </p>

<p>  One day Amooma decided to wait for the Goddess to appear. She
was shocked to see Apoopan eating the fried chicken. She became very
angry. When Apoopan saw her, he tried to run away. Amooma chased him
and he climbed a tree. Amooma hit the tree with a pole and Apoopan
fell into a well from the tree. </p>

<p>  "Cheating finally lands you in a well" said Amooma. </p>
