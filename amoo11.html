<h3> Chapter 11  </h3>
<h2>Feasting time </h2>
        

<p> One day, on his way home,  Apoopan passed the Zamindar's house. It
appeared that the Zamindar was celebrating something. </p>

<p> "What is going on here? Is there a feast going on here?" asked Apoopan. </p>

<p> "Yes" said the door man. "The Zamindar is holding a free feast
for Brahmins." </p>

<p> Brahmins were priests and considered to be higher caste.  Apoopan was
not a Brahmin. </p>

<p> "I wish I was a Brahmin. Then I could eat all that good food out
there. Oh! I wish I was a Brahmin" thought Apoopan to himself.

<p> He decided to move away from the place but he could not. The thought
of all the good food at the feast made him restless. Soon Apoopan had
an idea. </p>

<p> "I could easily pass off as a Brahmin. All I need is a thread to tie
around my waist."  </p>

<p> Before long, Apoopan tied a thread around his waist and put some
sandalwood paste on his head. He then went and sat for a free lunch at
the feast. Lunch was served on banana leaves. Apoopan was having a
good time eating at the feast till some ripe mango curry was
served. Now Apoopan had never eaten ripe mango curry in his life
before. He squeezed the mango, the seed popped out and went and fell
in to another man's banana leaf. </p>

<p> "Who is the low caste who cannot eat decently?" asked the angry
Brahmin on whose leaf Apoopan's mango seed had landed. </p>

<p> Calling someone low caste was just an angry expression of
Brahmins. But Apoopan thought he was found out.  </p>

<p> "That was me!" said Apoopan humbly. </p>

<p> Apoopan then  ran from the spot with all his might. </p>
