<h3> Chapter 4  </h3>
<h2>Amooma gets smart </h2>

<p> A group of people from town were visiting the village.  Apoopan kept
bringing the group home for lunch.  Amooma did not like the group of
people. They were freeloaders. There was nothing she could do. Apoopan
did not listen to her complaints. There was nothing she could do.  </p>

<p> One afternoon, as usual, Apoopan brought his new found friends home.
He seated them comfortably in his house.  He then told Amooma "Get
lunch ready for my friends. I will come back shortly. I am going to
the stream to take a bath." </p>

<p> After Apoopan left Amooma  put a flower garland on a pestle. The
group watched this act with bewilderment. </p>

<p> "Why are you garlanding the pestle?" asked one guest. </p>

<p> "My husband has this strange habit" said Amooma. "He befriends
people, usually strangers. He the brings them home and feeds them for a
few days. When they start to trust him he knocks them on the head with
this pestle. I think he is going to do that ritual today." </p>

<p> "Really? we better get out of here before he comes back then. Thank
you lady for telling us this" said one man. The group left the
house in a hurry. </p>

<p> When Apoopan came back he was surprised to see his friends gone.  </p>

<p> "Where are my friends?" he asked. </p>

<p> "They left because they were angry" said Amooma. </p>

<p> "Why were they angry?" asked Apoopan. </p>

<p> "They wanted this pestle and I refused to give it to them" said Amooma. </p>

<p> "Why did you refuse to give them this pestle?" asked Apoopan. "Don't
you know we must treat guests like gods? I will go and give them this
pestle right away." </p>

<p> Apoopan ran after his guests shouting </p>

<p> "Wait, wait. Take this." </p>

<p> When the group of freeloaders saw Apoopan running after them with
the pestle they were frightened and they ran even faster. </p>

<p> Apoopan kept shouting in vain </p>

<p> "Please come back, don't go away. Take this." </p>

<p> The group ran away and never came back to Apoopan's house again. </p>
