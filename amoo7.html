<h3> Chapter 7  </h3>
<h2>The pigeons dilemma</h2>
<p>        A pair of pigeons had build a nest near Apoopan's well. One day, by
accident, Apoopan kicked the nest and  three eggs from the nest
dropped in to the well. The pigeons told Apoopan </p>

<p> "Apoopan, Apoopan. Please fetch the three eggs you dropped in the
 water for us." </p>

<p> "No" said Apoopan. "I am quite busy right now." </p>

<p> So the pigeons flew around till they saw a wild pig, and they said </p>

<p> "Wild pig, wild pig. Will you go and mess up the farm of Apoopan who
did not fetch the three eggs he dropped in the water, for us?" </p>

<p> "No" said the wild pig. </p>

<p> So the pigeons flew further till they saw a hunter, and they said </p>

<p> "Hunter, Hunter. Will you shoot the wild pig, who did not mess the
farm of Apoopan, who did not fetch the three eggs he dropped in the
water, for us?" </p>

<p> "No" said the Hunter. </p>

<p> The pigeons flew further till they saw a fire and they asked </p>

<p> "Fire, fire. Will you set ablaze the mustache of the hunter who did
not shoot the wild pig, who did not mess the farm of Apoopan, who did
not fetch the three eggs he dropped in the water, for us?" </p>

<p> "No" said the fire. </p>

<p> So the pigeons flew further till they saw a stream and they asked </p>

<p> "Water Stream, Water Stream. Will you go and put off the fire, who
did not set ablaze the mustache of the hunter, who did not shoot the
wild pig, who did not mess the farm of Apoopan, who did not fetch the
three eggs he dropped in the water, for us?" </p>

<p> "No" said the water stream. </p>

<p> The pigeons flew further till They saw an elephant and they asked </p>

<p> "Elephant, elephant. Will you stamp the water stream and turn it
muddy, who did not put off the fire, that did not set ablaze the
mustache of the hunter, who did not shoot the wild pig, who did not
mess the farm of Apoopan, who did not fetch the three eggs he dropped
in the water, for us?" </p>

<p> "No" said the elephant. </p>

<p> So the pigeons flew further till they saw an ant and they asked </p>

<p> "Ant, ant. Will you bite the trunk of the elephant, who did not stamp
the water stream, who did not put off the fire, that did not set ablaze
the mustache of the hunter, who did not shoot the wild pig, who did not
mess the farm of Apoopan, who did not fetch the three eggs he dropped
in the water, for us?" </p>

<p> "Sure" said the Ant.  </p>

<p> The ant then ran and bit the elephant's trunk. The elephant ran and
turned the water stream muddy. The water stream ran and tried to put
off the fire. The fire ran and set ablaze the mustache of the hunter.
The hunter ran and tried to shoot the wild pig. The wild pig ran and
messed up Apoopan's farm. Apoopan ran and fetched the three eggs from
the well. </p>

<p> The pigeons thanked the little ant profusely. </p>
