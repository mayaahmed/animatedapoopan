<h2>Making vadas </h2>

<p> "I feel like eating paripu vadas (snack made of lentils)" said Amooma. </p>

<p> "Me too" said Apoopan. </p>

<p> "But there is no lentils, oil, or money" said Amooma. "How can we
make vadas?" </p>

<p> "Let me see what I can do" said Apoopan.  </p>

<p> Apoopan, then, went out of the house wearing a large towel on his
shoulder. </p>

<p> "What do you want?" asked the shopkeeper when Apoopan reached the
grocery store. </p>

<p> "I was thinking of buying some oil. Can I take a look?" asked Apoopan. </p>

<p> "Sure, go ahead" said the shopkeeper. </p>

<p> Apoopan looked at some large cans of oil. When no one was watching, he
slowly dropped his towel in to one can of oil. </p>

<p> "I dropped my towel in the can. Now it is all covered in oil. I have
to go home and get this washed. I will come back later to buy oil"
said Apoopan and he left the shop. </p>

<p> But instead of going home, Apoopan went to another grocery store and said </p>

<p> "I am looking for some lentils to buy." </p>

<p> Like before, under the pretext of selecting, Apoopan looked at sacks of
lentils, and he slowly dropped his towel in to one sack of lentils.
Lots of lentils got stuck to the oil covered towel. He picked up the
towel and said </p>

<p> "I will not buy lentils today. I will come back for it later." </p>

<p> Apoopan then went home and told Amooma </p>

<p> "Here I got you the oil and lentils necessary for the vadas. Make
good vadas. I will be back shortly." </p>

<p> Amooma shook the towel and gathered the lentils in a plate and she
squeezed the towel and collected the oil in a bowl. She murmured to
herself </p>

<p> "I do not understand why Apoopan cannot shop lentils in bags and oil
in bottles like other people." </p>

<p> Amooma made vadas. There were only a few and it looked delicious.
So Amooma started eating them one by one. By the time Apoopan came
back there was only one vada left. Apoopan got very angry and he
exclaimed </p>

<p> "How could you eat the vadas all by yourself?" </p>

<p> "Like this" said Amooma and ate the last Vada too. </p>
